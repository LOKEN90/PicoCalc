# PicoCalc
Programs written in MMBasic for use on Clockwork Pi PicoCalc 

NOTE: I'm not a professional programmer, I'm a biologist and this is a hobby. There will be mistakes, especially in organization and efficiency, please feel free to let me know where improvements can be made.

A collection of programs I am working on for use on the PicoCalc

Lander.bas - a lunar lander game inspired by a game that I enjoyed playing on my HP-35s. Each turn you control the amount of fuel used to slow the fall of the "Lander" and try to make it so that when it lands the veelocity is under 5 meters per second.

Mathtools.bas - A work in progress, probably always will be, that allows for mathematical formulas to be solved for different variables. Continued work will mainly be adding more formulae, improving UI, and adding diagrams to their respective formula. Added a more user friendly and modular menu system.

Constants.bas - A new program that I am working on and is in its early stages. It allows for a text file named constants.txt, located in the same directory as the program file, to be searched and to return the value of the searched for constant.  

Constants.txt - List of constants for use with constants.bas. Must be in same directory on picocalc. More constants will be uploaded later on. This is just a test batch containing the constants preprogrammed into the HP35s.
